# Compute homology
calculator = HomologyCalculator(chain_complex)
h1 = calculator.homology(1)
print(f"H‚ÇÅ free rank: {h1.free_rank}, torsion: {h1.torsion}")
```

## üìä Data Schema

Users provide their own chain complex data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "name": "My Custom Chain Complex",
  "grading": [0, 1, 2],
  "chains": {
    "0": {"basis": ["v1", "v2", "v3"], "ring": "Z"},
    "1": {"basis": ["e1", "e2", "e3"], "ring": "Z"},
    "2": {"basis": ["f1"], "ring": "Z"}
  },
  "differentials": {
    "1": [[1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]],
    "2": [[1, 1, 1]]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "description": "Custom surface code layout"

**Our Mission**: To build mathematical models for everyone by providing a foundation for chain complex analysis and surface code research. We try to focus on mathematical correctness and invite the community to help expand capabilities.

**Current Status**: This is a basic foundation that we're still building. We're working on features and welcome contributions from researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to help us improve.

**Join Us**: Help us transform this from a promising foundation into a more reliable, validated tool that meets the standards outlined in our [Mathematical Foundations](MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md).

### üåü **Our Learning Journey**

We believe in learning from failure and staying true to our mission: **building advanced mathematical models for everyone**. Every test failure teaches us something new about how to make our models more robust and mathematically sound.

We're incredibly grateful to contributors who help us improve our models, fix mathematical errors, and push the boundaries of what's possible. Your expertise and dedication help us move closer to our goal of making advanced mathematics accessible to everyone.

**Thank you for being part of this journey.** Together, we can build something truly valuable for the mathematical and scientific community.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note for Contributors**

**Current State**: This project is a **learning foundation** rather than a production-ready tool. While our basic mathematical theory is sound, our surface code implementations have fundamental errors that need fixing.

**What This Means**: 
- Researchers can't yet use this for quantum error correction research
- Students can learn chain complex theory, but surface code examples are broken
- Developers will need to fix core mathematical issues before building new features

**Why We're Sharing This**: We believe in transparency and collaboration. By working together, we can transform this from a promising but flawed foundation into a more reliable tool that better serves the community.

**Join Us**: Help us fix the math, improve the implementations, and build something groundbreaking together.
