# Quantum Error Correction Background

## Overview

This document provides the quantum error correction (QEC) background for the ChainComplex Surface Code Visualizer, explaining how surface codes are implemented via cell complexes and how stabilizer formalism relates to homology theory.

## Surface Codes and Cell Complexes

### Mathematical Foundation

Surface codes are a class of quantum error-correcting codes that can be naturally described using the language of algebraic topology and cell complexes. The key insight is that the stabilizer structure of a surface code corresponds directly to the boundary operators of a cell complex.

### Cell Complex Structure

A surface code is built on a 2D cell complex with the following structure:

```
C₂ → C₁ → C₀
```

Where:
- **C₀**: Vertices (0-cells) - data qubits
- **C₁**: Edges (1-cells) - measurement qubits  
- **C₂**: Faces (2-cells) - stabilizer measurements

The differential operators satisfy the fundamental condition:
```
∂₁∘∂₂ = 0
```

This ensures that stabilizers commute and the code is well-defined.

### Qubit Assignment

The physical qubits are assigned as follows:

1. **Data Qubits**: Placed on vertices (C₀)
2. **Measurement Qubits**: Placed on edges (C₁)
3. **Stabilizer Measurements**: Defined on faces (C₂)

This assignment creates a natural correspondence between the geometric structure and the quantum code structure.

## Stabilizer Formalism on the Cell Complex

### Stabilizer Definition

A **stabilizer code** is defined by a set of commuting operators (stabilizers) that leave the code space invariant. For surface codes, these stabilizers are constructed from the cell complex structure.

### Z-Stabilizers from Faces

Z-stabilizers are constructed from faces via the boundary operator ∂₂:

```
Z-stabilizer on face f = ∏_{e ∈ ∂₂(f)} Z_e
```

Where:
- `f` is a face in C₂
- `∂₂(f)` gives the edges bounding face `f`
- `Z_e` is the Z Pauli operator on edge `e`

**Mathematical Interpretation**: Each face defines a Z-stabilizer that acts on all edges bounding that face. The ∂₁∘∂₂ = 0 condition ensures that these stabilizers commute.

### X-Stabilizers from Vertices

X-stabilizers are constructed from vertices via the transpose of the boundary operator ∂₁:

```
X-stabilizer on vertex v = ∏_{e ∈ ∂₁^T(v)} X_e
```

Where:
- `v` is a vertex in C₀
- `∂₁^T(v)` gives the edges incident to vertex `v`
- `X_e` is the X Pauli operator on edge `e`

**Mathematical Interpretation**: Each vertex defines an X-stabilizer that acts on all edges incident to that vertex. The ∂₁∘∂₂ = 0 condition ensures that X and Z stabilizers commute.

### Stabilizer Commutation

The stabilizers commute because:

1. **X-X and Z-Z**: Commute by construction (Pauli operators of the same type commute)
2. **X-Z**: Commute due to the ∂₁∘∂₂ = 0 condition, which ensures that X and Z stabilizers overlap in an even number of qubits

## Relation to H₁ Homology

### Homology Groups

The homology group H₁(C) = ker(∂₁) / im(∂₂) plays a crucial role in surface codes:

- **ker(∂₁)**: Contains cycles (closed paths) in the cell complex
- **im(∂₂)**: Contains boundaries (paths that bound faces)
- **H₁(C)**: Represents nontrivial cycles that are not boundaries

### Logical Operators

Logical operators correspond to nontrivial homology classes in H₁(C):

1. **Toric Code**: H₁ has rank 2, giving two logical operators (X and Z)
2. **Planar Code**: H₁ has rank 1, giving one logical operator (boundary-dependent)

**Mathematical Construction**: Logical operators are representatives of homology classes that:
- Commute with all stabilizers
- Anticommute with each other (for independent logical operators)
- Have minimum weight within their homology class

### Example: Toric Code

For a toric surface code:

- **X Logical**: Horizontal cycle around the torus (nontrivial in H₁)
- **Z Logical**: Vertical cycle around the torus (nontrivial in H₁)

These operators anticommute because they intersect in an odd number of qubits, and they cannot be written as products of stabilizers.

### Example: Planar Code

For a planar surface code:

- **X Logical**: Path from left to right boundary (nontrivial in H₁)
- **No Z Logical**: The boundary conditions prevent a Z logical operator

The single logical operator is boundary-dependent and represents the nontrivial homology class.

## Threshold Behavior and Decoding

### Threshold Theorem

Surface codes exhibit a **threshold behavior** where:

- **Below threshold**: Logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance
- **Above threshold**: Logical error rate remains high regardless of code distance

The threshold is approximately **ε_th ≈ 0.94%** for surface codes, the highest known threshold for any quantum error-correcting code.

### Error Scaling

Below threshold, the logical error rate scales as:

```
ε_L ∝ (ε_p/ε_th)^(d/2)
```

Where:
- `ε_L` is the logical error rate
- `ε_p` is the physical error rate
- `ε_th` is the threshold error rate
- `d` is the code distance

### Decoding Algorithms

Several decoding algorithms are used with surface codes:

#### 1. Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM)
- **Principle**: Find optimal error correction by matching error syndromes
- **Complexity**: O(n³) where n is the number of qubits
- **Performance**: Optimal for independent errors
- **References**: [Fowler et al. (2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0928)

#### 2. Union-Find Decoder
- **Principle**: Cluster error syndromes and apply corrections
- **Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of qubits
- **Performance**: Near-optimal, faster than MWPM
- **References**: [Delfosse & Nickerson (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06218)

#### 3. Neural Network Decoders
- **Principle**: Use machine learning to predict error corrections
- **Complexity**: O(1) inference time after training
- **Performance**: Can approach optimal performance
- **References**: [Varsamopoulos et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08957)

### Syndrome Extraction

Error syndromes are extracted by measuring stabilizers:

1. **X-Syndromes**: Measured by X-stabilizers, detect Z-errors
2. **Z-Syndromes**: Measured by Z-stabilizers, detect X-errors
3. **Y-Errors**: Create both X and Z syndromes

The syndrome pattern provides information about the error locations, which the decoder uses to determine the optimal correction.

## Implementation Details

### Cell Complex Construction

The surface code implementation constructs cell complexes as follows:

#### Toric Code
- **Grid**: d×d square grid with periodic boundary conditions
- **Vertices**: d² data qubits
- **Edges**: 2d² measurement qubits (horizontal and vertical)
- **Faces**: d² stabilizer measurements

#### Planar Code
- **Grid**: (d+1)×(d+1) square grid with open boundaries
- **Vertices**: (d+1)² data qubits
- **Edges**: 2d(d+1) measurement qubits
- **Faces**: d² stabilizer measurements

### Stabilizer Mapping

The stabilizer mapping ensures:

1. **Commutation**: All stabilizers commute due to ∂₁∘∂₂ = 0
2. **Completeness**: Stabilizers generate the full stabilizer group
3. **Independence**: No stabilizer is a product of others
4. **Logical Operators**: Commute with all stabilizers

### Error Models

The implementation provides several error models:

1. **IID Pauli Noise**: Independent, identically distributed X, Y, Z errors
2. **Depolarizing Noise**: Equal probability of X, Y, Z errors
3. **Correlated Errors**: Spatially correlated error patterns

## Mathematical Rigor

### Chain Complex Validation

The implementation validates:

1. **∂₁∘∂₂ = 0**: Fundamental condition for well-defined code
2. **Matrix Dimensions**: Consistent with chain complex structure
3. **Integer Coefficients**: All differential entries are integers
4. **Homology Consistency**: H₁ rank matches expected logical operators

### Stabilizer Properties

The stabilizer formalism ensures:

1. **Commutation**: All stabilizers commute
2. **Completeness**: Stabilizers generate the full group
3. **Logical Independence**: Logical operators are independent of stabilizers
4. **Anticommutation**: Independent logical operators anticommute
