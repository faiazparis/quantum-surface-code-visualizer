# Mathematical Background

## Overview

This document provides the rigorous mathematical foundations for the ChainComplex Surface Code Visualizer, covering the theory of chain complexes, homology, and the computational methods used for integer arithmetic.

## Chain Complexes

### Definition

A **chain complex** is a sequence of abelian groups (or modules) connected by homomorphisms called **differential operators** or **boundary operators**:

```
... → C_{n+1} → C_n → C_{n-1} → ... → C_0 → 0
```

Where:
- `C_n` are the chain groups in degree `n`
- `d_n: C_n → C_{n-1}` are the differential operators
- The sequence continues indefinitely in both directions (though often bounded)

### Mathematical Structure

Formally, a chain complex `(C_•, d_•)` consists of:
- A family of abelian groups `{C_n}_{n∈ℤ}`
- A family of group homomorphisms `{d_n: C_n → C_{n-1}}_{n∈ℤ}`
- The fundamental condition: `d_{n-1} ∘ d_n = 0` for all `n`

### The Fundamental Condition: d² = 0

The condition `d_{n-1} ∘ d_n = 0` is the defining property of chain complexes. This means:

1. **Composition is zero**: For any element `c ∈ C_n`, we have `d_{n-1}(d_n(c)) = 0`
2. **Image containment**: `im(d_{n+1}) ⊆ ker(d_n)` for all `n`
3. **Boundary of boundary**: The boundary of a boundary is always zero

This condition has profound geometric and algebraic implications:
- **Geometric interpretation**: The boundary of a boundary is empty
- **Algebraic interpretation**: The image of one differential is contained in the kernel of the next
- **Topological interpretation**: Cycles (elements in the kernel) can be filled by boundaries (elements in the image)

### Examples

#### Triangle Chain Complex
Consider a triangle with vertices `v1, v2, v3`, edges `e1, e2, e3`, and face `f1`:

- **C₀**: Vertices (rank 3)
- **C₁**: Edges (rank 3)  
- **C₂**: Face (rank 1)

Differentials:
- `d₁: C₁ → C₀` maps edges to boundary vertices
- `d₂: C₂ → C₁` maps face to boundary edges

The d²=0 condition ensures that `d₁ ∘ d₂ = 0`, meaning the boundary of the face (sum of edges) has no boundary (each vertex appears twice, so sum is zero).

## Homology

### Definition

The **homology groups** of a chain complex are defined as:

```
H_n(C) = ker(d_n) / im(d_{n+1})
```

Where:
- `ker(d_n)` is the kernel of the differential operator `d_n`
- `im(d_{n+1})` is the image of the differential operator `d_{n+1}`
- The quotient `ker(d_n) / im(d_{n+1})` represents homology classes

### Geometric Interpretation

Homology groups capture topological features:

- **H₀**: Connected components
- **H₁**: Independent loops (1-dimensional holes)
- **H₂**: Independent cavities (2-dimensional holes)
- **Hₙ**: n-dimensional holes

### Betti Numbers

The **Betti numbers** `β_n` are the ranks of the free parts of homology groups:

```
β_n = rank(H_n(C))
```

The **Euler characteristic** is defined as:

```
χ = Σ(-1)^n β_n
```

### Torsion

Homology groups may have both free and torsion parts:

```
H_n(C) ≅ ℤ^{β_n} ⊕ T_n
```

Where:
- `ℤ^{β_n}` is the free part (rank `β_n`)
- `T_n` is the torsion part (finite abelian group)

Torsion represents finite cyclic factors in the homology.

## Integer Computations via Smith Normal Form

### Why Integer Arithmetic?

For chain complexes over the integers (ℤ), we use **Smith normal form (SNF)** instead of floating-point arithmetic because:

1. **Exactness**: Integer arithmetic gives exact results
2. **Torsion detection**: SNF reveals torsion factors precisely
3. **Mathematical rigor**: Avoids numerical errors from floating-point
4. **Topological invariance**: Results are true topological invariants

### Smith Normal Form

#### Definition

For any integer matrix `A`, there exist unimodular matrices `P` and `Q` such that:

```
D = P * A * Q
```

Where `D` is diagonal with divisibility condition: `d_i | d_{i+1}` for all `i`.

#### Properties

- **Unimodular**: `P` and `Q` have determinant ±1
- **Diagonal**: `D` is diagonal with integer entries
- **Divisibility**: Each diagonal element divides the next
- **Uniqueness**: `D` is unique up to sign changes

#### Algorithm

The SNF computation involves:
1. **Row/column operations**: Elementary operations preserving determinant
2. **GCD computations**: Finding greatest common divisors
3. **Modular arithmetic**: Working over finite fields during computation
4. **Back-substitution**: Reconstructing transformation matrices

### Kernel and Image Rank

#### Kernel Rank

The **kernel rank** of matrix `A` is the dimension of the solution space to `Ax = 0`:

```
ker_rank(A) = dim(ker(A)) = number of zero diagonal elements in SNF
```

#### Image Rank

The **image rank** of matrix `A` is the dimension of the column space:

```
im_rank(A) = dim(im(A)) = number of non-zero diagonal elements in SNF
```

### Torsion Invariants

#### Extraction

Torsion invariants are extracted from the diagonal of SNF:

```
torsion = [(p, k) for d in diagonal if d ≠ 0, ±1]
```

Where `(p, k)` represents a `ℤ/p^kℤ` factor.

#### Example

For diagonal `[1, 2, 0, 6, 0]`:
- `2 = 2^1` → torsion factor `(2, 1)`
- `6 = 2^1 × 3^1` → torsion factors `(2, 1)` and `(3, 1)`
- Result: `[(2, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)]`

## Trade-offs and Numeric Considerations

### Advantages of SNF

1. **Exact computation**: No numerical errors
2. **Torsion detection**: Complete information about finite factors
3. **Mathematical rigor**: Results are true invariants
4. **Stability**: No accumulation of floating-point errors

### Disadvantages of SNF

1. **Computational complexity**: Exponential in worst case
2. **Memory usage**: Intermediate matrices can be large
3. **Integer overflow**: Large numbers may exceed machine precision
4. **Algorithm complexity**: SNF algorithms are sophisticated

### Performance Considerations

#### Complexity

- **Best case**: O(n³) for typical matrices
- **Worst case**: Exponential for pathological cases
- **Average case**: O(n³ log n) for random matrices

#### Memory Usage

- **Transformation matrices**: O(n²) storage for P, Q
- **Intermediate results**: O(n²) working memory
- **Large matrices**: May require sparse representations

#### Numerical Stability

- **Integer overflow**: Use arbitrary-precision arithmetic for large matrices
- **GCD computation**: Requires careful implementation
- **Modular arithmetic**: Intermediate computations may use finite fields

### Alternatives and Hybrid Approaches

#### Floating-Point SVD

For large matrices where exactness is not critical:
- **Advantages**: Faster, lower memory usage
- **Disadvantages**: Numerical errors, no torsion information
- **Use case**: Approximate homology for very large complexes

#### Modular Methods

For torsion detection in large complexes:
- **Advantages**: Faster than full SNF, reveals torsion
- **Disadvantages**: May miss some information
- **Use case**: Torsion detection in large-scale computations

#### Sparse Methods

For sparse differential matrices:
- **Advantages**: Memory efficient, faster for sparse matrices
- **Disadvantages**: More complex implementation
- **Use case**: Large, sparse chain complexes

## Implementation Details

### Matrix Representation

Differential operators are represented as:
- **Integer matrices**: `numpy.ndarray` with `dtype=int`
- **Sparse matrices**: For large, sparse differentials
- **Block matrices**: For structured chain complexes

### Validation

#### d²=0 Check

The fundamental condition is verified by:
1. **Matrix multiplication**: `d_{n-1} @ d_n`
2. **Zero check**: `np.allclose(result, 0, atol=1e-10)`
3. **Shape validation**: Matrix dimensions must be consistent

#### Integer Coefficient Check

Ensures all coefficients are integers:
```python
np.allclose(matrix, matrix.astype(int))
```

### Error Handling

#### Common Errors

1. **d²≠0**: Fundamental condition violated
2. **Dimension mismatch**: Matrix shapes inconsistent
3. **Non-integer coefficients**: Floating-point values detected
4. **Memory overflow**: Matrix too large for computation

#### Error Messages

Provide informative error messages:
- **Mathematical context**: Explain what condition was violated
- **Specific details**: Point to exact location of error
- **Suggestions**: Provide guidance on fixing the issue
