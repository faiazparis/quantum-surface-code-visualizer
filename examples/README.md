# Examples Directory

This directory contains examples demonstrating the ChainComplex Surface Code Visualizer framework. These examples show what's currently working and highlight areas where we welcome contributions.

## üéØ Why These Examples Matter

### **Problem 1: Learning Surface Codes is Abstract**
**The Challenge**: Understanding how chain complexes relate to surface codes requires seeing concrete examples. Mathematical theory alone isn't enough - you need to see the computation in action.

**Our Solution**: Working examples that show the complete pipeline from JSON data to homology computation to surface code analysis.

### **Problem 2: Research Tools are Fragmented**
**The Challenge**: Researchers often build one-off scripts for their specific needs, making it hard to compare approaches or build on previous work.

**Our Solution**: Standardized examples that demonstrate best practices and can be extended for new research directions.

### **Problem 3: Validation is Manual and Error-Prone**
**The Challenge**: Checking that your chain complex design is mathematically correct requires manual verification of d¬≤ = 0 and other properties.

**Our Solution**: Examples that show automated validation in action, catching errors before they propagate to your research.

### **Problem 4: Novel Designs are Hard to Explore**
**The Challenge**: Standard surface codes (toric, planar) are well-understood, but novel geometries require new tools and analysis methods.

**Our Solution**: Framework examples that show how to extend the system for custom layouts and geometries.
