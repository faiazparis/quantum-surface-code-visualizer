## 🔬 Why Your Contributions Matter

### **Problem 1: Research is Fragmented**
**The Challenge**: Surface code research is scattered across different tools, formats, and implementations. Researchers can't easily compare approaches or build on each other's work.

**Your Impact**: Help create a unified framework that makes research reproducible and collaborative.

### **Problem 2: Mathematical Tools are Inaccessible**
**The Challenge**: Advanced mathematical concepts like homology computation and Smith Normal Form are implemented in expensive, closed-source software or require deep mathematical expertise.

**Your Impact**: Help make these tools free, open-source, and accessible to everyone.

### **Problem 3: Innovation is Limited**
**The Challenge**: Without proper tools, researchers are stuck with standard surface code layouts. Novel geometries that might have better performance remain unexplored.

**Your Impact**: Help build tools that enable exploration of new surface code designs and their properties.

### **Problem 4: Education is Difficult**
**The Challenge**: Learning surface codes and algebraic topology requires understanding both the mathematics and how to implement it computationally.

**Your Impact**: Help create examples, documentation, and tools that make learning easier for the next generation of researchers.

## 🔬 Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Mathematical Validation (Required)

**All contributions must maintain mathematical correctness:**

```bash
# Run basic validation tests
pytest -v

# Run critical mathematical tests
pytest -m "critical" -v

# Check test coverage
pytest --cov=ccscv --cov-report=term-missing
```

**What we validate:**
- **d² = 0**: Boundary operators must satisfy ∂₁∘∂₂ = 0
- **Homology**: Basic homology computation must be correct
- **Structure**: Chain complex dimensions and relationships must be consistent

**Note**: We're building the validation framework - help us make it more comprehensive!

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### 1. Python Style

**We follow PEP 8 with flexibility:**

```python
# Good: Clear and readable
def compute_homology(chain_complex: ChainComplex, dimension: int) -> HomologyResult:
    """
    Compute homology group for given dimension.
    
    Args:
        chain_complex: Input chain complex
        dimension: Dimension to compute homology for
        
    Returns:
        HomologyResult containing free rank and torsion invariants
    """
    pass

# We're flexible about:
# - Line length (reasonable is fine)
# - Import organization (logical grouping)
# - Variable naming (clear is better than perfect)
```

### 2. Mathematical Notation

**Use clear mathematical language:**

```python
# Good: Clear mathematical meaning
def d_squared_zero_condition(self) -> bool:
    """Check that ∂² = 0 holds for all boundary operators."""
    pass

# Good: Mathematical variable names
def compute_betti_number(self, dimension: int) -> int:
    """Compute Betti number β_n = rank(H_n)."""
    pass

# Avoid: Unclear abbreviations
def d2_zero(self) -> bool:  # Unclear what d2 means
    pass
```

### 3. Error Messages

**Helpful error messages:**

```python
# Good: Clear and helpful
if not np.allclose(composition, 0):
    raise ValueError(
        f"d² = 0 condition violated: ∂_{n-1} ∘ ∂_{n} ≠ 0\n"
        f"Composition matrix:\n{composition}\n"
        f"Expected: zero matrix"
    )

# Avoid: Too generic
if not np.allclose(composition, 0):
    raise ValueError("Validation failed")
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### 1. Test Structure

**Organize tests logically:**

```python
class TestHomologyComputation:
    """Test homology group computation."""
    
    def test_sphere_homology(self):
        """Test H₀(S²) = ℤ, H₁(S²) = 0, H₂(S²) = ℤ."""
        # Test implementation
        
    def test_torus_homology(self):
        """Test H₀(T²) = ℤ, H₁(T²) = ℤ², H₂(T²) = ℤ."""
        # Test implementation
```

### 2. Property-Based Testing (Optional)

**Use Hypothesis when helpful:**

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.integers(1, 10), st.integers(1, 10))
def test_boundary_operator_properties(rows: int, cols: int):
    """Test that randomly generated boundary operators satisfy d² = 0."""
    # Generate test data
    # Verify mathematical properties
```

### 3. Edge Cases (Encouraged)

**Test important edge cases:**

```python
def test_empty_chain_complex(self):
    """Test homology computation for empty chain complex."""
    pass

def test_large_matrices(self):
    """Test performance with large boundary operators."""
    pass
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### 1. Reasonable Expectations

**We aim for:**
- **Correctness**: Mathematical accuracy above all
- **Readability**: Code that others can understand and modify
- **Reasonable Performance**: Not necessarily optimal, but not terrible

**We're flexible about:**
- Exact performance benchmarks
- Memory usage optimization
- Algorithm complexity (within reason)

### 2. When to Optimize

**Optimize when:**
- **Performance is critical**: Large-scale problems
- **Memory is limited**: Resource-constrained environments
- **User experience**: Interactive applications

**Don't optimize when:**
- **Premature**: Before correctness is proven
- **Readability**: If it makes code harder to understand
- **Maintenance**: If it makes debugging harder
